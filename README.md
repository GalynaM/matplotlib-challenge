# matplotlib-challenge
Initial data had beed clean to remove duplicate Mice
Summary statistics of the tumor volume for each drug regimen were generated 
Bar Charts to show the number of mice for each drug regimen were added, using both Pandas and Matplotlibpie
Pie Charts to show the distribution of male/female mice in the study were added, using both Pandas and Matplotlibpie
Boxplot to compare distribution of tumor volume by four drug regimen and spot outliers was added
Line plot generated to analyze progression of tumor for a specific mouse
Scatter Chart generated to see if there is a correlation btw mouse weigh and average tumor volume
Correlation and Linear regression model between mouse weigh and average tumor volume was calculated and visualized via Scatter and Line Plots
Analysis of the received data had been added
